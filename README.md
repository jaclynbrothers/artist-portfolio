## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I focused on creating a website for fmsilver where they could showcase their work within their own studio. 

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would like to add a dark mode for the website along with 3D features so the user could feel like they were walking around each piece or seeing multiple views and be able to interact with it to learn more. 

## Lessons Learned

I experimented with colors and detailed descriptions of each work for screen readers and overall accessibility. =
